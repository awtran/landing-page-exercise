#Virta Health - Coding Assessment

This is my submission of the coding assessment presented by the design team at Virta Health. I was asked to recreate a static mockup of a landing page they had.

**Things to note**
The site was coded in vanilla HTML/CSS. No JavaScript was used on the following premises:
1. The image given to me was already static.
2. The content provided on the image gave no indication/need to require extensive animation (that CSS couldn't already provide).

I did my best to recreate the landing page as if it was live on Virta's current site. Things such as button hover animations and links to content was recreated to the closest form of what it is currently.

*I'm also open to feedback of any sort with my code! I appreciate any suggestions as I'm looking to always improve the way I code and structure my syntax*/
